# This R script is designed to perform a detailed statistical analysis on a dataset, focusing on identifying the best-fitting probability distributions for key variables and conducting descriptive and inferential statistical tests. The script begins by importing multiple datasets, merging them based on a unique identifier, and saving the resulting combined dataset. It then explores various theoretical distributions—such as normal, log-normal, exponential, and Poisson—using Maximum Likelihood Estimation and compares them using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to determine which model fits the data best.

# The second part of the script emphasizes hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It includes performing Levene’s test for equality of variances, the Brunner-Munzel test for group comparisons, and comparing results with classical tests like the t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Additionally, it generates descriptive statistics tables suitable for publication and produces an automated EDA report containing visualizations and summaries. This script offers a complete workflow for analyzing structured data, combining both parametric and non-parametric methods to derive meaningful insights from real-world datasets
