# This R script is designed to perform statistical analysis on a dataset, focusing on understanding variable distributions, identifying the best-fitting probability models, and conducting descriptive and inferential statistical tests. The script begins by importing multiple datasets, merging them based on a common identifier, and saving the combined dataset for further analysis. It then explores various probability distributions such as normal, lognormal, exponential, and Poisson using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, comparing them with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to determine the optimal fit for each variable.

# The second part of the script focuses on hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It includes performing Leveneâ€™s test for variance homogeneity, applying the Brunner-Munzel test for group comparisons, and contrasting results with traditional t-tests and Wilcoxon tests. Additionally, it generates descriptive statistics tables suitable for publication and creates an automated EDA report that includes visualizations and summaries. This script provides a robust framework for analyzing real-world data, supporting both parametric and non-parametric approaches to draw meaningful conclusions from the dataset.
