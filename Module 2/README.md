# This R script provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing a dataset with missing values, guiding the user through data preparation, missing data assessment, imputation, and outlier detection. It begins by loading essential libraries and reading the dataset, followed by selecting and organizing relevant variables for analysis. The script then calculates and visualizes patterns of missing data, helping to understand the extent and structure of incomplete information in the dataset.

# A key part of the analysis involves determining whether missing data is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) using Little’s test, which informs decisions on how to handle missing values. Based on the results, the script performs multiple imputations using two methods—Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) and Random Forest (RF)—and visually compares their effectiveness. Finally, it detects outliers using boxplots and the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method, offering both statistical insight and visual interpretation to identify unusual observations that may affect further analysis.
